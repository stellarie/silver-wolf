            She toyed with the joystick, day in, day out.
            <br />
            A fast food restaurant with only one employee, a basement turned into an arcade hall, several old arcade machines — this was her childhood.
            <br />
            She didn't have a legal name or an identity number, only a nickname the proprietress chose for her.
            <br />
            She did not have any friends, but she is not lonely.
            <br />
            She liked the game of Pong — two lines and a dot of light, the simplest of ball games. She could play it for a whole day.
            <br />
            She liked Battle Wheel 32 — eight blocks of different colors on a matrix-drawn sky. There was only one rule: Win, no matter what.
            <br />
            She liked Geometric Wars, Odysseus, and Star Cheetah. The score records on these games were filled with astronomical numbers left by other patrons.
            <br />
            She toyed with the joystick, day in, day out.
            <br />
            Until one day, only one name remained on all of the score records.
            <br />
            She set down the joystick and looked around the empty basement.
            <br />
            Many people have sought respite in this place, but few stayed behind.
            <br />
            Many have left, but few returned.
            <br />
            She blinked and turned off the screen.
            <br />
            That night, the only employee of the fast food restaurant said goodbye to proprietress, and became the next person to leave.
            <br />
            The game called Basement ended that night.
